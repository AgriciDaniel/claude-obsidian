## [2026-04-29] session | JobFilter build session (intake weapon + CI fix + wiki canon)
- Type: build session
- Locations (new): `wiki/meta/2026-04-29-jobfilter-build-session.md`, `wiki/concepts/JobFilter Status.md`, 6 product concept pages, 1 feedback memory
- Shipped: PR #37 (intake 4-step + GOLD/SILVER/BIN + WhatsApp + landing rebuild), fixed CI on PR #36 (commit `ba267a4`), canonicalised Vantage/Vicinity/Codex defs from project memory

## [2026-04-29] save | JobFilter product features + onboarding stages
- Type: product knowledge
- Locations (new): `wiki/concepts/JobFilter Onboarding Stages.md`, `wiki/concepts/JobFilter Product Features.md`
- Content: 6-stage tradesman funnel, GOLD/SILVER/BIN filter engine rules, WhatsApp alert format, planned features (QR sticker, Stripe, auth)

## [2026-04-24] save | v1.6.0 public release notes (Teams, Karpathy-style)
- Type: release doc + visual assets
- Locations (new): `docs/releases/v1.6.0.md` (346 lines, 6 sections, Karpathy-style prose), `wiki/meta/dragonscale-mechanism-overview.svg` (4-mechanism diagram with shared .vault-meta/ gate), `wiki/meta/dragonscale-6-test-flow.svg` (validation timeline), `wiki/meta/dragonscale-frontier-graph.svg` (M4 candidate + 3 filed pages)
- Locations (modified): `wiki/meta/2026-04-24-v1.6.0-release-session.md` (cross-reference added pointing to public release notes)
- Scope: Teams approach. R1 (chair) wrote 3 original SVGs per SVG Diagram Style Guide. R2 (codex worker) drafted Karpathy-style release prose. R3 (chair) stitched SVGs, pivoted Wikipedia imagery to text links only (no binary vendoring per permission). R4 (codex verifier) returned ACCEPT WITH FIXES, 3 wording fixes on version narrative. R5 (chair) applied fixes, committed.
- Style: direct, short, signal-dense, lists over prose, no em dashes, no marketing terms. Verifier confirmed zero em-dashes and zero banned marketing language ('revolutionary', 'seamless', 'world-class', 'game-changing', 'unlock', 'transform').
- Distribution (all three destinations covered): (1) `docs/releases/v1.6.0.md` public-facing file (commit `85515bb`), (2) `wiki/meta/2026-04-24-v1.6.0-release-session.md` internal engineering record (cross-linked), (3) GitHub Release body (user to paste from docs/releases/v1.6.0.md when ready to `gh release create v1.6.0`).
- Wikipedia imagery: referenced as text link to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve` rather than hotlinked or vendored. Cleaner license-wise (no CC-BY-SA attribution needed) and no external dependency. The 3 original SVGs carry the visual load instead.
- PII scan post-write: `docs/releases/v1.6.0.md` + all three SVGs are clean. No `/home/` paths, no real emails, no tokens.
- Next recommended: user runs `gh release create v1.6.0 --notes-file docs/releases/v1.6.0.md` when ready to cut the public release. This also creates the annotated tag.

## [2026-04-24] save | DragonScale end-to-end validation pass (Teams, 6 tests)
- Type: validation + first real fold + first real autoresearch
- Tests executed (all green):
  - T0 ollama pull `nomic-embed-text`: done (274MB, 15s wall)
  - T1 M1 dry-run k=3 via codex: DRY-RUN OK, 8 children, no em-dashes
  - T2 M2 real allocate: counter advanced 2 to 3, got `c-000002` (unassigned reservation; gap acceptable per spec)
  - T3 M3 full tiling with model present: 41 pages scanned, 21 embedded, 20 correctly skipped (meta/excluded/embed-error), 0 errors at >=0.9, 15 pairs in 0.8-0.9 review band (top 0.8822 Compounding Knowledge vs LLM Wiki Pattern, a legitimate semantic neighbor), report at `wiki/meta/tiling-report-2026-04-24.md`
  - T4 M1 commit via codex: first real fold committed, `wiki/folds/fold-k3-from-2026-04-23-to-2026-04-24-n8.md` (115 lines, 8 children, flat extractive). Flips the long-standing "no fold committed yet" status
  - T6 M4 autoresearch no-topic via codex: selected "How does the LLM Wiki pattern work?" as candidate (score 1.7022, #3 after skipping top-1 source + top-2 self-reference); 6 web fetches (Karpathy gist, RAG paper arXiv 2005.11401, MemGPT arXiv 2310.08560, Obsidian docs); 3 new concept pages filed, each with Primary Sources
- Locations (new): `wiki/folds/fold-k3-from-2026-04-23-to-2026-04-24-n8.md`, `wiki/meta/tiling-report-2026-04-24.md`, `wiki/concepts/Persistent Wiki Artifact.md`, `wiki/concepts/Source-First Synthesis.md`, `wiki/concepts/Query-Time Retrieval.md`
- Locations (modified): `.vault-meta/address-counter.txt` (2 to 3), `wiki/index.md` (3 concept links), `wiki/concepts/_index.md` (3 concept links)
- Scope: six-test menu the user approved. Codex gpt-5.4 for T1/T4/T6 (sub-agent delegation); chair for T0/T2/T3 (one-shot shell) and all integration (index, log, hot, commit).
- Style: all new content uses colons or parens instead of em-dashes. Pre-existing em-dashes in index entries and wiki/concepts/_index.md left as-is (clean-room boundary; deferred to F-slice style pass).
- Tests still green: `make test` passes (74+ assertions).
- Integration: chair added the 3 new concepts to `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/concepts/_index.md` with colon-style descriptions so the fresh pages are discoverable. The cluster extends `[[How does the LLM Wiki pattern work?]]` and cross-references `[[LLM Wiki Pattern]]`.
- Next recommended slice: either (G) commit this test batch and declare v1.6.0 validated, or (H) run a second fold k=3 now that 8 newer entries exist above this one and close the hierarchical-fold-not-yet-supported loop in a future phase.

## [2026-04-24] save | v1.6.0 closeout (Teams, chair-led)
- Type: docs + release hygiene
- Locations (new): wiki/meta/2026-04-24-v1.6.0-release-session.md (release session summary, 346 lines), wiki/meta/boundary-frontier-2026-04-24.md (first M4 run artifact against this vault), docs/dragonscale-guide.md (user-facing DragonScale guide, 563 lines)
- Locations (modified): wiki/hot.md (tag-claim fix, Scripts line adds boundary-score, tests line adds test_boundary_score, push-line drift, tiling line-count, one em-dash), docs/install-guide.md (version 1.5.0 to 1.6.0, DragonScale callout expanded to all four mechanisms, "hierarchical log folds" corrected to "flat extractive log folds", points to docs/dragonscale-guide.md), README.md (DragonScale parenthetical expanded to all four mechanisms plus guide link)
- Scope: Teams approach, chair-led. Slice A (2 codex read-only explorers: closeout punch list + doc-surface map). Slice B (6 bounded writes: 4 chair, 2 codex workers, non-overlapping write scopes). Slice C (codex adversarial verifier, ACCEPT WITH FIXES). Slice D (fix pass + log entry + manual commit of docs + README).
- Verifier: C1 found 11 items across 6 files. All 11 applied. Flag typos `--allow-remote-ollama` and `--report PATH` corrected in release-session; boundary-frontier provenance corrected to `--top 7` to match default vs explicit top; hot.md tiling line-count claim stripped to avoid drift; hot.md "local tag only" corrected to "local commits only, no git tag"; install-guide log-fold wording corrected from "hierarchical" to "flat extractive"; dragonscale-guide rollback wording corrected (`.vault-meta/` is a shared gate across M2+M3+M4, not per-mechanism).
- Model: codex gpt-5.4 used throughout. User requested gpt-5.5; not reachable via codex CLI 0.123.0 / this account at the time. models_cache lists max gpt-5.4, and the API rejects gpt-5.5 with "does not exist or you do not have access". Existing config already has `service_tier = "fast"` and `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`, matching the "fast for chatgpt with permission of full access" intent.
- Tests: `make test` passes. test_allocate_address.sh (shell, 12 assertions), test_tiling_check.py (python, 18 assertions), test_boundary_score.py (python, 44 assertions). Zero ollama dependency.
- Tags: still no local v1.5.0 / v1.5.1 / v1.6.0 tags. User controls tag creation and push. Pre-existing tags unchanged (v1.1, v1.4.0 through v1.4.3).
- Deliberately NOT done: no real M1 fold committed; no M3 end-to-end run (needs `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`); pre-existing em-dashes in install-guide.md and README.md left untouched (clean-room boundary, not in write scope this slice); CLAUDE.md pre-existing uncommitted change left untouched.
- Next recommended slice: either (E) push to origin/main and create annotated tags v1.5.0, v1.5.1, v1.6.0 in landing order, or (F) dedicated style pass to scrub pre-existing em-dashes across install-guide.md, README.md, and any other wiki files flagged by a grep scan.

## [2026-04-24] save | DragonScale Phase 4 — boundary-first autoresearch shipped (v1.6.0)
- Type: feature release
- Locations (new): scripts/boundary-score.py (with --top, --page, --json, stdout-only CLI), tests/test_boundary_score.py (40+ assertions)
- Locations (modified): skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md (new Topic Selection section A/B/C with helper-failure fallback), commands/autoresearch.md (no-topic candidate flow with agenda-control label), wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md (v0.4: M4 flipped from NOT IMPLEMENTED to shipped; exact formula without recency floor; filename-stem disclosure; fence-handling qualifiers), CHANGELOG.md, .claude-plugin/{plugin,marketplace}.json (1.5.0 -> 1.6.0), Makefile (test-boundary target), wiki/hot.md, wiki/index.md, wiki/concepts/_index.md (status drift resolved).
- Scope: boundary-first autoresearch as opt-in Topic Selection mode. `/autoresearch` without a topic surfaces top-5 frontier pages; user picks/overrides/declines. Explicit helper-failure fallback to user-ask. Labeled "agenda control" throughout to match the spec's scope disclosure.
- Correctness: filename-stem resolution including folder-qualified `[[notes/Foo]]` -> Foo.md. Self-loops, unresolved targets, meta-targets, symlinks, and vault escapes all excluded. Code-fence parser handles backticks AND tildes with CommonMark length tracking (longer opening fence is not closed by shorter inner fence). Indented blocks intentionally not filtered (Obsidian bullet convention).
- Recency: exp(-days/30), no floor. Stale pages approach zero weight so they do not dominate frontier ranking.
- Review rounds: codex adversarial Phase 4 round 1 (10 items: 7 reject + 3 refine). Round 2 (7 accept + 3 still-reject: folder-qualified stem, docstring floor mention, hot.md historical drift). Round 3 (3 accept, PASS).
- Phase 3.6 (pre-Phase-4 hardening) already landed as v1.5.1: tiling --report VAULT_ROOT confinement, rollout baseline, AGENTS.md consistency, wiki-ingest .raw/ contradiction, install-guide version.
- All four DragonScale mechanisms now shipped and opt-in. 44 commits ahead of origin/main, no push.

## [2026-04-24] save | DragonScale Phase 3.5 — cross-phase hardening to v1.5.0
- Type: release hardening
- Locations (new): bin/setup-dragonscale.sh (opt-in installer), tests/test_allocate_address.sh, tests/test_tiling_check.py, Makefile, CHANGELOG.md
- Locations (modified): hooks/hooks.json (+.vault-meta/ staging), agents/wiki-ingest.md (single-writer rule for addresses), agents/wiki-lint.md (Mechanism 2+3 checks), skills/wiki-ingest/SKILL.md (aligned non-DragonScale wording), wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md (M2 severity matches lint, M4 marked NOT IMPLEMENTED, seed page gets address c-000001), .claude-plugin/{plugin.json,marketplace.json} (1.4.2/1.4.3 → 1.5.0), README.md (11 skills + DragonScale callout), wiki/hot.md (refreshed for v1.5.0), .raw/.manifest.json (address_map now has DragonScale Memory.md → c-000001), .gitignore (.vault-meta/.tiling.lock + cache), .vault-meta/address-counter.txt (advanced to 2).
- Scope: resolve the 10 hold-ship items from the cross-phase audit. Add reproducible test harness (make test passes). Version-bump plugin.json and marketplace.json to 1.5.0. Create CHANGELOG.md. Refresh hot cache.
- Review rounds: codex 3.5a (5/5 accept on doc/agent fixes), codex final holistic (10/10 accept on audit items + 2 surgical regression fixes: wiki-ingest/wiki-lint non-DragonScale wording alignment, README skill count).
- Tests: `make test` runs 12 shell assertions (allocator) + 18 python assertions (tiling-check). All pass; no ollama dependency.
- Phase 3.5 complete. Repo state: 6 developer commits added this pass (f2e73c1, 2b49a0c, 8b28e48, 19ad7e4, 365f557, 2e7dd16). Total 39 commits ahead of origin/main. No push.

## [2026-04-24] save | DragonScale Phase 3 — semantic tiling MVP
- Type: skill update + new script + threshold state
- Locations: scripts/tiling-check.py (485 lines), .vault-meta/tiling-thresholds.json (seed defaults), skills/wiki-lint/SKILL.md (109-line Semantic Tiling section + item #10 in checks), wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md (Mechanism 3 cost framing clarified)
- Scope: opt-in embedding-based duplicate detection via ollama nomic-embed-text. Default bands error>=0.90, review>=0.80, explicitly documented as conservative seeds (not literature-backed interpolation). Calibration procedure documented, not automated.
- Security: default OLLAMA_URL locked to 127.0.0.1; non-localhost requires --allow-remote-ollama flag. Symlinks and vault-root escapes rejected before file reads (prevents data exfil).
- Correctness: cache keyed on sha256(model+body); orphan GC on save; model-drift auto-invalidation on load.
- Concurrency: flock(LOCK_EX) on .vault-meta/.tiling.lock; per-PID temp file for atomic writes.
- Scale: warn >500 pages; hard-fail exit 4 at >5000 pages.
- Exit codes: 0/2/3/4/10/11 distinctly surfaced in wiki-lint wiring (not collapsed into "unknown").
- Review rounds: 4 codex exec adversarial passes covering security, cache correctness, feature gate, inclusion logic, scale, threshold honesty, concurrency, exit codes, model drift, terminology coupling.
  Round 1: 10 items -> 7 reject + 3 refine.
  Round 2: 6 accept + 4 still-reject (symlink ordering, prose sync, exit-code wiring, terminology in checklist + "no API cost" claim).
  Round 3: 3 accept + 1 still-reject (cost-framing phrasing).
  Round 4: accept.
- Final verdict: 10/10 accept.
- Phase 3 complete. All three DragonScale mechanisms that were in-scope for the initial spec are now shipped as opt-in features. Mechanism 4 (boundary-first autoresearch) was flagged as agenda-control out-of-scope per the v0.2 scope boundary; may or may not ship as a future phase.

## [2026-04-23] save | DragonScale Phase 2 — deterministic page addresses MVP
- Type: skill update + new script
- Locations: scripts/allocate-address.sh, skills/wiki-ingest/SKILL.md (Address Assignment section), skills/wiki-lint/SKILL.md (Address Validation section), wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md (Mechanism 2 rewritten v0.2→v0.3), .vault-meta/address-counter.txt, .raw/.manifest.json (new)
- Scope: MVP address format `c-NNNNNN` (creation-order counter, zero-padded 6 digits). Rollout baseline 2026-04-23. Legacy pages exempt until deliberate backfill (future `l-` prefix). No content hash, no fold-ancestry encoding in the MVP (both deferred).
- Concurrency: atomic allocation via flock-guarded Bash helper. Counter recovery from max observed `c-` address, never silent reset to 1.
- Lint: post-rollout pages without address are errors; legacy pages without address are informational. Optional `.vault-meta/legacy-pages.txt` manifest grandfathers pages with missing/wrong `created:` metadata.
- Re-ingest idempotency: `.raw/.manifest.json` `address_map` preserves path→address mapping across re-ingests and renames.
- Naming: mechanism renamed from "content-addressable paths" to "deterministic page addresses" (the MVP is a counter, not a content hash; the old name was overclaim).
- Review rounds: 2 codex exec adversarial passes. Round 1: 8 rejects covering counter mutation, race conditions, uniqueness atomicity, missing-file recovery, terminology drift, silent regression path, legacy classification, re-ingest idempotency. Round 2: 7 accept + 1 reject (manifest.json absent). Round 3 (item 8 only): accept after creating `.raw/.manifest.json`.
- Final verdict: 8/8 accept.
- Phase 2 complete. Phase 3 (semantic tiling lint) gated on human approval.

## [2026-04-23] save | DragonScale Phase 1 — wiki-fold skill shipped
- Type: skill
- Location: skills/wiki-fold/SKILL.md, skills/wiki-fold/references/fold-template.md
- Scope: flat extractive fold over raw wiki/log.md entries. Dry-run default via Bash stdout (no Write tool, avoids PostToolUse hook residue). Structural idempotency via deterministic fold_id. Duplicate-range detection. Fold-of-folds explicitly out of scope.
- Review rounds: 3 codex exec adversarial passes. Round 1: 1 refine + 6 reject across 7 items (allowed-tools, hook-mutation risk, idempotency claim, dry-run faithfulness, children structure, Mechanism 1 coverage, auto-commit conflict). Round 2: 6 accept + 1 reject (25/26 count inversion). Round 3 (item 4 only): accept.
- Final verdict: 7/7 accept.
- Dry-run artifact: /tmp/wiki-fold-dry-run-v2.md (not committed). fold_id: fold-k3-from-2026-04-10-to-2026-04-23-n8.
- Phase 1 complete. Phase 2 (content-addressable paths) gated on human approval.

## [2026-04-23] save | DragonScale Memory v0.2 — post-adversarial-review
- Type: concept revision
- Location: wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md
- Review: codex exec adversarial review rejected all 7 load-bearing claims in v0.1
- Changes: weakened LSM analogy, removed strong prompt-cache claim, replaced 0.85 threshold with calibration procedure, justified 2^k as MVP convenience, acknowledged scope-boundary leak for boundary-first autoresearch, added Operational Policies section (retention/tombstones/versioning/conflict/concurrency/provenance/ACL), tagged claims as [sourced]/[derived]/[conjecture], narrowed tagging scope per re-review
- Re-review result: 7/7 accepted (after one surgical fix on tagging-scope language)
- Phase 0 complete. Phase 1 (wiki-fold skill) gated on human approval.

## [2026-04-23] save | DragonScale Memory — Phase 0 design doc (proposed)
- Type: concept
- Location: wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md
- From: brainstorming session on applying Heighway dragon curve properties to LLM wiki memory architecture
- Scope: memory-layer only, NOT agent reasoning. Four mechanisms: (1) fold operator (LSM-style exponential compaction at 2^k log entries), (2) content-addressable page paths for prompt-cache stability, (3) semantic tiling lint (embedding-based dedup, 0.85 cosine threshold), (4) boundary-first autoresearch scoring
- Status: proposed. Phase 0 pending codex adversarial review. Phase 1+ (fold skill, address anchors, tiling lint, boundary score) gated on review pass.
- Primary sources verified: Dragon curve (Wikipedia, boundary dim 1.523627086), Regular paperfolding sequence (OEIS A014577), LSM trees (arXiv 2504.17178, LevelDB 10x level ratio), MemGPT (arXiv 2310.08560), Anthropic prompt caching docs (5min/1hr TTL, 20-block lookback)
- Links updated: wiki/concepts/_index.md, wiki/index.md

- Type: session
- Location: wiki/meta/claude-obsidian-v1.4-release-session.md
- From: full release cycle covering v1.1 (URL/vision/delta tracking, 3 new skills), v1.4.0 (audit response, multi-agent compat, Bases dashboard, em dash scrub, security history rewrite), and v1.4.1 (plugin install command hotfix)
- Key lessons: plugin install is 2-step (marketplace add then install), allowed-tools is not valid frontmatter, Bases uses filters/views/formulas not Dataview syntax, hook context does not survive compaction, git filter-repo needs 2 passes for full scrub
