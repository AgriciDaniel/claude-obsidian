  Autonomous iterative research loop. Takes a topic, runs web searches, fetches sources,
  synthesizes findings, and files everything into the wiki as structured pages.
  Based on Karpathy's autoresearch pattern: program.md configures objectives and constraints,
  the loop runs until depth is reached, output goes directly into the knowledge base.
  Triggers on: "/autoresearch", "autoresearch", "research [topic]", "deep dive into [topic]",
  "investigate [topic]", "find everything about [topic]", "research and file",
  "go research", "build a wiki on".

# autoresearch: Autonomous Research Loop

> **Vault resolution**: The vault and plugin are separate directories. Before using any paths, read `skills/wiki/references/vault-resolution.md` to resolve `VAULT_ROOT` (where `wiki/`, `.raw/`, `.vault-meta/` live) and `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (where `scripts/` lives). All `wiki/` paths below are relative to `VAULT_ROOT`. All `scripts/` paths are relative to `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`.

You are a research agent. You take a topic, run iterative web searches, synthesize findings, and file everything into the wiki. The user gets wiki pages, not a chat response.

This is based on Karpathy's autoresearch pattern: a configurable program defines your objectives. You run the loop until depth is reached. Output goes into the knowledge base.

## Before Starting

Read `references/program.md` to load the research objectives and constraints. This file is user-configurable. It defines what sources to prefer, how to score confidence, and any domain-specific constraints.

---

## Topic Selection

Three paths to a topic:

### A. Explicit topic (always respected)
When the user says `/autoresearch [topic]` or "research X", use the given topic verbatim and skip the sections below.

### B. Boundary-first selection (agenda control, opt-in)
**This is agenda control, not pure memory.** DragonScale Memory.md Mechanism 4 labels this mechanism as such because it shapes which direction the research agent moves next. Users who want a strict memory-layer subset should omit this path entirely.

When `/autoresearch` is invoked WITHOUT a topic AND the vault has adopted DragonScale, default to surfacing the frontier of the vault as a set of candidate topics the user can accept, override, or decline.

Feature detection (shell):

```bash
if [ -x "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/boundary-score.py" ] && [ -d "$VAULT_ROOT/.vault-meta" ] && command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  BOUNDARY_MODE=1
else
  BOUNDARY_MODE=0
fi
```

When `BOUNDARY_MODE=1`:

1. Run `python "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/boundary-score.py" --json --top 5`. Returns the top 5 frontier pages by `boundary_score = (out_degree - in_degree) * recency_weight`.
2. **Helper failure handling**: if the helper exits non-zero, emits invalid JSON, or returns an empty `results` array, set `BOUNDARY_MODE=0` and fall through to section C below. Do NOT prompt the user with an empty candidate list, and do NOT improvise a topic.
3. Present the candidate list to the user: "Your top frontier pages are: [list]. Research which one? (1-5, or type a topic to override, or say 'cancel' to be asked normally.)"
4. If the user picks 1-5, use the selected page's title as the topic.
5. If the user types free text, use that.
6. If the user cancels or does not choose, fall through to C.

The boundary score is a heuristic, not an objective measure of what SHOULD be researched. The user always has the option to type a free-text topic to override the surfaced candidates.

**Link-resolution semantics**: the boundary helper uses **filename-stem wikilink resolution only**. `[[Foo]]` is counted as an edge to `Foo.md` anywhere in the vault. Aliases declared via frontmatter `aliases:` are **not** parsed. Folder-qualified links (e.g. `[[notes/Foo]]`) are resolved by stem only. This matches default Obsidian behavior for unique filenames but does not implement full Obsidian alias resolution.

### C. User-chosen (default when B is unavailable)
When `BOUNDARY_MODE=0` or the user declined every frontier pick, ask: "What topic should I research?"

## Research Loop

```
Input: topic (from Topic Selection, above)

Round 1. Broad search
1. Decompose topic into 3-5 distinct search angles
2. For each angle: run 2-3 WebSearch queries
3. For top 2-3 results per angle: WebFetch the page
4. Extract from each: key claims, entities, concepts, open questions

Round 2. Gap fill
5. Identify what's missing or contradicted from Round 1
6. Run targeted searches for each gap (max 5 queries)
7. Fetch top results for each gap

Round 3. Synthesis check (optional, if gaps remain)
8. If major contradictions or missing pieces still exist: one more targeted pass
9. Otherwise: proceed to filing

Max rounds: 3 (as set in program.md). Stop when depth is reached or max rounds hit.
```

## Filing Results

After research is complete, create these pages:

**wiki/sources/**. One page per major reference found
- Use source frontmatter (type, source_type, author, date_published, url, confidence, key_claims)
- Body: summary of the source, what it contributes to the topic

**wiki/concepts/**. One page per significant concept extracted
- Only create a page if the concept is substantive enough to stand alone
- Check the index first: update existing concept pages rather than creating duplicates

**wiki/entities/**. One page per significant person, org, or product identified
- Check the index first: update existing entity pages

**wiki/questions/**. One synthesis page titled "Research: [Topic]"
- This is the master synthesis. Everything comes together here.
- Sections: Overview, Key Findings, Entities, Concepts, Contradictions, Open Questions, Sources
- Full frontmatter with related links to all pages created in this session

## Synthesis Page Structure

```markdown
---
type: synthesis
title: "Research: [Topic]"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - research
  - [topic-tag]
status: developing
related:
  - "[[Every page created in this session]]"
sources:
  - "[[wiki/sources/Source 1]]"
  - "[[wiki/sources/Source 2]]"

# Research: [Topic]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of what was found]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1 (Source: [[Source Page]])
- Finding 2 (Source: [[Source Page]])
- ...

## Key Entities
- [[Entity Name]]: role/significance

## Key Concepts
- [[Concept Name]]: one-line definition

## Contradictions
- [[Source A]] says X. [[Source B]] says Y. [Brief note on which is more credible and why]

## Open Questions
- [Question that research didn't fully answer]
- [Gap that needs more sources]

## Sources
- [[Source 1]]: author, date
- [[Source 2]]: author, date
```

---

## After Filing

1. Update `wiki/index.md`. Add all new pages to the right sections
2. Append to `wiki/log.md` (at the TOP):
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] autoresearch | [Topic]
   - Rounds: N
   - Sources found: N
   - Pages created: [[Page 1]], [[Page 2]], ...
   - Synthesis: [[Research: Topic]]
   - Key finding: [one sentence]
   ```
3. Update `wiki/hot.md` with the research summary

---

## Report to User

After filing everything:

```
Research complete: [Topic]

Rounds: N | Searches: N | Pages created: N

Created:
  wiki/questions/Research: [Topic].md (synthesis)
  wiki/sources/[Source 1].md
  wiki/concepts/[Concept 1].md
  wiki/entities/[Entity 1].md

Key findings:
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

```

---

## Constraints

Follow the limits in `references/program.md`:
- Max rounds (default: 3)
- Max pages per session (default: 15)
- Confidence scoring rules
- Source preference rules

If a constraint conflicts with completeness, respect the constraint and note what was left out in the Open Questions section.
